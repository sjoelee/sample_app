Questions
==========
1. What do attributes: accept-charset, action, class, id, and method in the form tag do (Refer to Listing 7.20)?
A1. 
 - The post method - Rails knows to construct a form with this method, which is
   the way of creating a new object. 
 - action and method attributes work together to post what the users have
   inputted to the /users URI?? We'll see what it really does. 

2. Why don't we create a route for the errors webpage?
A1. Maybe because there is no routing necessary. We're not following a specific
URI. 

3. How is en.yml linked??
 3a. How is it that deleting password: true get rid of the duplicity?

Notes
=====
1. For the error messages webpage, we don't have to create a route for it.
